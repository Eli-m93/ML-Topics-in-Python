# ML-Topics-in-Python


# Hello!
These files are example code, write-ups, and general testing of new ideas in ML. Some of this information is taken from Harvard's Introduction to Data Science Course and MIT's Inference on Causal and Structural Parameters using ML and AI (which I am a student in).


Please be mindful: this is an ongoing process, there might be grammatical errors or unfinished ideas, I am currently still writing the introductions to explain the ideas (like how the model specification for Lasso).
